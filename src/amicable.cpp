/*
 * The main thing I'm worried about here is computation time.
 *
 * Okay I thought about it for a little bit, and have decided on a strategy.
 *
 * I'm going to go through all the numbers under 10000 and determine the sum of factors for each number.
 * I thought about using Sieve of Eratosthene's or Pollard's Rho, but I don't want to implement all that.
 *
 * I'll test all numbers less than sqrt(n). I'll keep a running total of the sum. Then,
 * I'll insert that into an unordered_map<int,int> that maps number to sum of factors,
 * and also update an unordered_map<int,unordered_set<int>>, where the key is the sum of factors, and we'll insert the
 * number into the value-unordered_set. That'll give fast-lookup times when searching for pairs.
